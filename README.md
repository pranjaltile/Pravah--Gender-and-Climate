## A Brief of the Prototype:
Solution Overview: Our solution is a web-based platform named Sync - Enhancing Relationship for Gender and Climate Change. The platform aims to visualize the intricate relationship between gender inequality and climate change through a dynamic and interactive experience. By displaying critical environmental data (such as pollution levels, waste management, and energy consumption) and connecting it to gender-related impacts, Sync helps communities and decision-makers understand how climate change disproportionately affects different genders.

## Code Execution Instruction:
1. Repository Setup
